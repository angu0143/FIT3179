      <p>
        This dashboard visualises youth crime in Australia, focusing on how crime rates vary across different states and offence categories. Understanding patterns of youth offending is critical for policymakers, researchers, and communities who aim to address the underlying social, economic, and cultural factors contributing to youth involvement in crime. This visualisation provides a clear and interactive way to examine these trends by transforming complex crime data into an accessible, visual format. It allows users to compare offence rates between states, identify which types of offences are most prevalent among young people, and observe any regional disparities.

            This map visualises the distribution of youth offences detected across Australian <strong>states and
              territories</strong>, showing the <strong>number of youth offenders</strong> by <strong>offence
              type</strong> and location. Each state is represented according to the level and type of youth crime
            recorded, allowing for easy comparison across regions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The data shows that offences such as Acts Intended to Cause Injury, Theft, and Public Order Offences are
            the most frequently detected among young people, particularly in New South Wales, Queensland, and
            Victoria. In contrast, serious offences like Homicide and Abduction/Harassment occur far less often and
            are scattered across fewer states.

        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            The overall map highlights that youth crime is most concentrated in the eastern states, with smaller
            totals in the Northern Territory, South Australia, and the Australian Capital Territory, providing a clear
            visual summary of where and which types of youth offences are most prominent across Australia.

      <h3>Youth Offenders by Age & Sex</h3>
      <div class="line-text">
        <p>
          The line chart reveals a clear and consistent pattern in <strong>youth offender rates</strong> by
          <strong>age</strong> and <strong>sex</strong> between 2022 and 2023. Offending behaviour increases sharply
          with age for both males and females, peaking around mid- to late-adolescence. For <strong>males</strong>, the
          offender rate climbs rapidly from <strong>197 per 100,000 at age 10</strong> to a peak of
          <strong>4,354.9 per 100,000 at age 16</strong>, before slightly declining at age 17.
          <strong>Females</strong> show a similar upward trend, though at much lower levels, rising from
          <strong>66.3 per 100,000 at age 10</strong> to <strong>1,816.9 per 100,000 at age 14</strong>, followed by
          moderate fluctuations through the later teenage years. Across all ages, male youth offenders significantly
          outnumber females, indicating a persistent gender gap in offending patterns.
        </p>
        <p>
          These results suggest that youth crime involvement intensifies through early adolescence; potentially linked
          to social, socioeconomic, and peer influences, before stabilising as individuals approach adulthood. The
          sharper escalation among males may reflect differences in behavioural risk factors, socialisation, and
          exposure to criminogenic environments.

        <h3>Youth Offenders Detention Rate</h3>
        <div id="vis_bar" class="vis-container"></div>
      </div>
      <div class="chart-description">
        <p>
          Notably, there is a stark disparity in youth detention rates between <strong>Aboriginal and Torres Strait
            Islander</strong> and <strong>Non-Indigenous</strong> populations across Australian states and territories.
          Overall, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youths are detained at significantly higher rates in every
          jurisdiction. The highest detention rates are observed in Queensland (46.0 per 10,000) and the Northern
          Territory (42.9 per 10,000), followed closely by Western Australia and the Australian Capital Territory (both
          at 34.6 per 10,000).
        </p>
        <p>
          In contrast, Victoria and Tasmania record comparatively lower rates, though these figures remain many times
          higher than those of Non-Indigenous youths. Across all states, Non-Indigenous youth detention rates remain
          consistently low, <strong>below 2.5 per 10,000</strong>, illustrating a persistent and
          <strong>systemic over-representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youths in detention</strong>.
          This pattern underscores enduring inequalities in the justice system and reflects broader social, economic,
          and cultural disadvantages experienced by Indigenous communities nationwide.

    <!-- Scatter Plot -->
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Socioeconomic Advantage vs Youth Offence Rate</h3>
      <div class="scatter-wrapper">
        <div id="vis_scatter" class="vis-container"></div>
      </div>
      <p>
        The scatter plot visualisation highlights a negative correlation between socioeconomic advantage (measured by
        SEIFA) and youth offence rates across Australian states and territories. States with
        <strong>lower average SEIFA scores</strong>, such as the Northern Territory (875) and Queensland (963), record
        the <strong>highest youth offence rates</strong> (2855 and 1863 per 100,000 youths respectively). In contrast,
        states with <strong>higher SEIFA scores</strong>, notably the Australian Capital Territory (1,089) and Victoria
        (997), show substantially <strong>lower offence rates</strong> (528.9 and 1,126.6 per 100,000 youths).
      </p>
      <p>
        This pattern suggests that regions with <strong>greater socioeconomic disadvantage tend to experience higher
          levels of youth offending</strong>, reflecting the influence of structural inequality, limited educational and
        employment opportunities, and social marginalisation on crime involvement. The trend reinforces criminological
        theories linking socioeconomic stressors to delinquency and demonstrates how youth justice outcomes are strongly
        shaped by broader social and economic conditions across Australia.
